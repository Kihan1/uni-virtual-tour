                    Welcome to the Campus
                    The size and friendly nature of Bangor means it is easy to get to know people and our students settle in immediately. Most of the University buildings and student villages are within walking distance of the city centre so you're never far from shops, pubs and cafes of all types. On the University campus, there is a range of eating venues which are open to all.
                    
                    Fit for Life
                    Both of our student accommodation villages are equipped with state-of-the art sports and fitness facilities. Following a multi-million pound refurbishment, the Brailsford Centre at the Ffriddoedd student village is home to three gyms, two sports halls, two studios, a climbing wall and an indoor tennis and netball facility.
                    
                    At the St Mary's student village there is a fitness suite and an outdoor multi-use games area.
                    
                    Gym membership is included in the cost of all Bangor University accommodation.
                    
                    Campus Life
                    The Campus Life programme is run by the Residential Life team and students for all residents of University halls and aims to help you get the most from your time in halls. Events include kayaking, mountain walks, film nights, live music nights, pizza parties and workshops â€“ and it's all free.
                    
                    "I love the size of both the University and the area. It's easy to meet people and make new friends, and everything and everyone are never too far away."
